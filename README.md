# Plan My Trip 

Our Team was assigned with the project of Generating a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data we gathered in previous projects, we used our API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, and finished with creating a DataFrame containing the updated weather data.
